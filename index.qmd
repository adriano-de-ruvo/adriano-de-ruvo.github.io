Ciao! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Economics at [Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu).

I am interested in **political economy**, **public economics** and **growth**; I like studying the interplay between culture, institutions and economic outcomes.

I received my BSc and MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/master-science/economic-and-social-sciences). Before starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant for Professor Marco Tabellini (Harvard University) and Professor Paola Giuliano (UCLA). I was also an intern at the Department of Territorial Economic Analysis and Research of the [Bank of Italy](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/ricerca-economica/index.html).

I grew up in Rome, went to college in Milan, and traveled around Europe for a year prior to moving to Providence, RI to begin my Ph.D.
