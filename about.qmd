I grew up in Rome, went to college in Milan, and traveled around Europe for a year before moving to Providence, RI to begin my Ph.D.



I received a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Economics and Social Sciences from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/master-science/economic-and-social-sciences).



Before starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant for Professor Marco Tabellini (Harvard University) and Professor Paola Giuliano (UCLA). I was also an intern at the Department of Territorial Economic Analysis and Research of the [Bank of Italy](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/ricerca-economica/index.html).
