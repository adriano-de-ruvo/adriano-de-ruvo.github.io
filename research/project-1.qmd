Over the past three decades, the world economy has witnessed the irresistible rise of China as a global trade power. Since opening up to foreign trade and implementing free-market reforms, China has moved rapidly from the periphery to the very top of the world trade hierarchy.[^1] China's spectacular economic advancement and trade openness has not led to substantial changes in the structure of its domestic political regime, which has continued to take on the features of a solid autocracy.[^2]

During the same period of time, the wave of democratization that had swept the world since the end of the Cold War, has lost momentum, leading many countries to slow down their democratization process or even recede into autocratic terrain. While being widespread, this trend is relatively new in recent history. In the past decade, for the first time since World War II, countries experiencing episodes of autocratization have persistently outnumbered those that were democratizing (see Panel A above). As shown in Panel B above, Chinese trade expansion and the erosion of democracy have advanced hand in hand in the past decades, but are these phenomena related? Can China's rise as a commercial superpower and autocratic outpost explain part of the ongoing democratic recession?

I would like to study whether China's trade growth has contributed to the decline of democracy across the world. More generally, I aim to explore the possibility that trade, acting both as a shock to different institutional settings and as a source of integration among them, is able to influence their dynamics.

[^1]: According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Statistics, China overtook the United States as the world's largest trading nation in 2013 and has steadily ranked first and second in global shares of exports and imports, respectively, since 2009 ([UNCTAD 2020 Handbook](https://unctad.org/webflyer/handbook-statistics-2020)). According to IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics database, as of 2018, almost two-thirds of world countries trade more with China than the United States ([IMF Statistics Department, 2010](https://data.imf.org/)).

[^2]: The World Bank describes China's growth as "*the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in history*". Between 1991 and 2020, real annual GDP growth averaged 9.3%. Freedom House's 2022 country report continues to place China among the lowest ranks in terms of political rights and civil liberties, further stating that "*China's authoritarian regime has become increasingly repressive in recent years*" ([Freedom House 2022](https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-world/2022)).
